In this step, you will import the starter project and add the Apollo Android SDK to it.

## Clone the starter project

```
git clone https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android-tutorial
cd apollo-android-tutorial
git checkout initial
```

At any time, if you want to check the finished result, you can checkout the `master` branch that contains all the code to book your seat.

## Open the project in Android Studio

Android Studio will take some time to index the contents of the project. Take some time to look around. You should see 3 Fragments:

* `LaunchListFragment` is the first fragment. You will display a list of launches there.
* `LaunchDetailsFragment` will display details about a launch and give you the opportunity to book a seat.
* `LoginFragment` will allow you to log in before booking the seat.

Build and run the project, you should see an empty app. That's good!

Now you will add Apollo Android to the project.

## Get the latest version of Apollo Android

You can find the latest version of Apollo Android from the [github releases page](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/releases). It is also displayed at the top of the [apollo-android repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/)

This tutorial uses `2.1.0` because it is the latest version at the time of writing but feel free to use a more recent version if one is available when you're reading this.

## Add the plugin to the buildscript

Open the `build.gradle.kts` at the root of the project and add the Apollo Gradle plugin to the buildscript classpath:

```kotlin:title=build.gradle.kts
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath("com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.0.0")
        // ...
        classpath("com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-gradle-plugin:2.1.0")
    }
}
```

## Apply the plugin

Apply the Apollo plugin in `app/build.gradle.kts`. There are two `build.gradle.kts` in the project. Make sure to use the one in the `app` directory this time. The Apollo plugin ID is `com.apollographql.apollo`.

```kotlin:title=app/build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("com.android.application")
    // ...
    id("com.apollographql.apollo")
}
```

The plugin contains the compiler that will generate models from your queries when you build your project.

## Configure Kotlin

Configure the Apollo plugin to generate Kotlin files instead of Java files. Put this at the end of `app/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin:title=app/build.gradle.kts
apollo {
    generateKotlinModels.set(true)
}
```

## Add dependencies

Now add the Apollo runtime to the list of dependencies. This is the actual code that will run on the device:
Also add `apollo-coroutines-support`. That will help to schedule the queries.

```groovy:title=app/build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk7:$kotlin_version"
    // ...
    implementation 'com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-runtime:2.1.0'
    implementation 'com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-coroutines-support:2.1.0'
    // ...
}
```

Android Studio will display a yellow banner, `A project sync may be necessary for the IDE to work properly.` Hit **Sync Now**.

If everything went well, Apollo Android is now added to your project. Next, you will [add the GraphQL schema to the project](02-add-the-graphql-schema).
