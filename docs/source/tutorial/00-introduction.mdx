Welcome! This tutorial demonstrates adding the Apollo Android SDK to an app to communicate with a GraphQL server. In this tutorial you will learn how to:

* Download as schema.
* Write queries, mutations and generate the corresponding Kotlin models.
* Handle errors and loading states.
* Handle pagination.
* Authenticate with a backend server.

The tutorial uses an instance of [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) hosted on heroku, including the [corresponding GraphiQL explorer](https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/). If you're curious about how to build your own server, check the [Apollo fullstack tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/).

All the code for this tutorial is available at [https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android-tutorial](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android-tutorial).

## What are you building?

In this tutorial, you will build an app that allows you to book a seat on a rocket sent to space by [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/).

The tutorial uses the following tools and frameworks:

* [Android Studio 4.0.0](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* Kotlin and [Kotlin coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)
* [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding), [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started), [ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout) and [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview).
* [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) for image loading.

That's a lot to cover and outside the scope of this tutorial so this tutorial uses a starter project available at https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android-tutorial so you can focus on the GraphQL parts.
